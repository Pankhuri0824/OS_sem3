Firstly the entire program is running within the while loop that allows us to read input from file Q3IN.txt. Here it reads the contents of the input file line by line in each loop iteration and assigns variables to each line with space separated values of number 1 number 2 and the operator. Then a simple if-elif-else statement operates that first checks what the operator is and then according has the code to evalute the expression. If some wrong operator is given it gives an error. 
Finally we cretae a directory Q3 from the code as instructed and store all output of the file in a file in that directly. ( the file is also created by the code)
